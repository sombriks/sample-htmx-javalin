# [sample-htmx-javalin][00]
[![Java CI with Gradle](https://github.com/sombriks/sample-htmx-javalin/actions/workflows/gradle.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sombriks/sample-htmx-javalin/actions/workflows/gradle.yml)

Sample application showing how htmx teams up with javalin

## Dependencies

- java 17 or newer
- kotlin 1.9
- jdbi 3.44
- htmx 2.x
- apache velocity 2.3
- spock 2.3

A [good kotlin ide][10] is also recommended.

## How to build

We have [shadow jar plugin][20] to ease runnable jar creation

```bash
./gradlew shadowJar
```

## How to run

We have [application plugin][30] to ease runnable jar creation options

```bash
./gradlew run
```

Alternatively, run the jar built in previous step:

```bash
java -jar build/libs/sample-htmx-javalin-1.0-SNAPSHOT-all.jar
```

## Noteworthy

- [Shadow plugin][20] does similar job done by [maven shade plugin][40]
- Javalin supports a good range of [template engines][50], just pick one
- There are a good amount of [logging options][60] to Javalin
- [Testing Javalin][01] is simple and ergonomic thanks to its testing library
- [Spock][90] demands us to enable the groovy language in the project
- Groovy support has issues to proper set jvm toolchain, fallbacks to system
- There is a [nice htmx plugin][70] for intellij
- JDBI [fluent api][80] makes database access easier
- TodoItem needs an empty constructor so JDBI bean mapper can fill attributes in
- [Intellij coverage plugin has an issue with velocity][11]

## Next steps

- [ ] Find a good form to object mapper would be handy. Javalin has
  [validators][90] but besides that, form to model mapping is pretty much manual
- [ ] Need a coverage solution that handles spock properly
- [ ] Setup docker image building and registry publishing
